# BurntMemory
extremely minimal memory manipulation library

Very work in progress. Mostly a learning project.

Currently consists of:
* A little singleton to manage attaching to a process and getting module addresses.
* A read/write library to simply read/writeProcessMemory stuff and resolve pointers.

More error handling and unit testing to come.

Also I hope to implement some breakpoint setting stuff but we'll see.
